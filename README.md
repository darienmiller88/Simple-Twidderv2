## Rebuilding my first simple twitter clone using Svelte for practice.

### Built With

* [Svelte]()
* [MongoDB Atlas]()
* [Netlify]()
* [Fiber](https://gofiber.io/)

### Requirements
* Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/darienmiller88/Simple-Twidderv2`
* Migrate the necessary information to your local `.env` as described in the `.env_sample` file
* Run `go build` to create a root level `Messenger.exe` file, and then run `.\Messenger` to run the executable. If an executable is not needed, simply input `go run main.go` instead, or `.\fresh` to enable a server restart on change.
* `cd` into the `client` folder, and run `npm start` to the react server, which should be on port 3000
